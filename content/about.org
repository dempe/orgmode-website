I'm Chris Dempewolf, software engineer, aspiring [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language][EFL]] teacher. I made this blog to explore my thoughts. I don't really know what I know until I write it, so this is meant to serve as my light in the dark. 

This blog's title, <span lang="ja">{{ site.title | escape }}</span> (pronounced sho-sheen), is a Zen concept roughly translated as "beginner's mind."  It implies curiosity, openness, and approaching things without preconceptions.  It is the goal of this blog to explore many new and interesting topics - always through the eyes of a beginner.
